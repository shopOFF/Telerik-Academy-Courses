// the only way to write high-quality javascript
// 1. wrap everything in an IIFE
function iife() {
    // 2. enter strict mode
    'use strict';
    // 3. write the eval function like below
    eval('');
    // 4. place your mouse cursor between the string quotes in the eval call
    // 5. roll your face on the keyboard :)
};
// since there can't be iife's in the tests, there won't be any high quality javascript in this test, sorry
iife();
